Tinsel - Virtual Machine files

Tinsel	Is 		Not a 		Super 		Elongated 	Loop
T		I		N     		S     		E			L



The tinsel virtual machine consists of two registers A ( r0 ) and B ( r1 )
The instruction set is defined in "Assembly Language of Virtual Machine - Spreadsheet"



VM Code files:

The VM code first starts with the MAGIC character 'T'
The VM code then continues with the version number 0x01
Then the VM code file contains a u16 containing the size of the code segment (up to 65536 bytes)
Then the VM code file contains a u16 containing the size of the data segmetn (up to 65536 bytes)
Then the VM code file contains a u16 containing the entry point of the program (usually 0x0000)

The header of a VM code file is 8 bytes.

Next the VM code file contains the code segment, of the size defined earlier.
Next the VM code file contains the data segment, of the size defined earliers.

The VM should load the code segment to 0x00000000 in the machines memory.
The VM should load the data segment afther the code segment in the machines memory.

The VM will then jump to the entry point.
